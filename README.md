# path
Path is a command-line tool to manage PATH environment variable on Windows.
It's a successor to my PathCleaner project.

# why
PATH management is hard, and PATH becomes a cluttered thing over time. I also
wanted to develop a tool with .NET 6 + System.CommandLine + Spectre.Console
to learn more about them.
